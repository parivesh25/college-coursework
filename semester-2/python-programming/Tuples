TUPLES
1. Tuples are immutable.
2. It is used to multiple items in a single variable.
3. It is ordered and inchangable.
4. It allows duplicate elements.

CHANGES IN TUPLES
We can make changes in tuple by type casting it to list and then we can make changes and modify the tuple by the list fucntions
after converting it to list

UNPACKING OF A TUPLES
converting a tuple into variables
Eg. animals = ('cat','dog','bear')
    (var1,var2,var3) = animals
    print(var1)
    print(var2)
    print(var3)

METHOD OF TUPLES
1. count() - no. of times a specific value is occuring in a tuple.
Syntax:  <tuple>.count(<item>)

2. index() - position of a specific value in a tuple.
Syntax: <tuple>.index(<index>)

CONCATENATION OF TUPLE
Tuples can be merged
Eg. animals = ("zebra","horse","cat","dog","lion")
    birds = ("Peacock", "Chicken", "Ostrich", "DODO")
    animals += birds
    print(animals)
    print(birds)

REPLICATION OF A TUPLE
we can replicate the tuple multiple times by multiplication operator
Eg. animals = ("zebra","horse","cat","dog","lion")
    birds = ("Peacock", "Chicken", "Ostrich", "DODO")

    three = animals * 4
    print(three)
